<h1>My Rainbow 6 Siege Attack ops</h1>

<p> In Rainbow 6 Siege or “r6s” there are about more than 75 operators or “ops\op4s” for both the attacking side and defending side I have at least 3 different ops for both sides that I either main or love using. For attack I like using Monty(Montagne), Hibana, Nomad, nøkk. I like using these ops starting with my top 1 which is Hibana she is a hard breacher from the SAT forces I like her because she has a really good ak which is special to her called the “type-89” I started liking this op because when I first started I managed to pull the ak’s black ice or a skin the has a 1/100 chance of pulling and she is a good hard breacher to meaning she has the ability to use her x-kratos pellets to destroy metal reinforced walls. Then there is Monty he is a shield op from the GIGN forces I like using him because all shield ops are hard to use especially him his ability is that when you have your shield out you can extend it to be able to cover door ways or rotations into site I like him because he is a good support op that can help cover your team and having those attacking you be more focused on you other than your teammates. Another good op I tend to pick on if ith other team makes no rotations or have a really small amounts of access into site is Nomad she is a support op from the GIGR she has a special ability where I can shoot her “air-jabs” or little goo pellets that stick to anything and if a defender comes near it it will launch them back and making a sound que to let team know where they are. And finally there is Nøkk she has a ability called the “HEL presence reduction devices” where to defenders cameras she is invisible and when walking she is has something called a “silent step” passive ability where some ops when using their ability or not while walking don't make a sound which is good because r6s is a game of sound so you can sneak around into site and ace against the other team with out them knowing where you came from.</p>

<h2> My Rainbow6 Siege Defence ops</h2>

<p>My favortie ops on the defence side is Warden, Azami, Tubarao, and Solis because the are both good ops.Next is warden he is a secret service. I like him because his ability “Glance glasses” which when on can reduce flash bangs and be able to see through smoke grenades if you make low movements I use him in maps with small crucial areas like in the map oregon through the main balcony into the 2nd floor sites there is a set of bunk beds to your right with immediate access to a site and plant the defuse I can counter this by using warden with his shotgun to hold that area if they through a flash or smoke I can use the glasses and when the hop in with vision clears a day to them and not knowing I have countered their play and with his back up Smg pistol the smg-12 to hit longer ranged enemies.  And finally Azami she was friends with Hibana back in Japan she has a ability called a “Kiba barrier” which covers a small area in a ice cover to cover rotations made by the attackers to enter the building. I Like her because not only she wastes so much time for the attackers but with a suppressor vertical grip with I like using the sight reflex b but you can chose what you want but makes her SMG visual and gun kick recoil pretty much nonexistent. Solis is a technology user from the “Ghosteyes” group which specialize in technology ops within the r6s community or home base of Rainbow Operations I like her because her ability called the “SPEC-10” googles which can detect attacking ops devices so like when the are using there drones, electronic abilities or something that uses technology like a phone and when her specs are on you can overclock them near devices to see who is using them and what they are doing plus she is a good roamer which means once the prep\drone they immediately leave site so the attacker drones can’t spot them and they are constantly moving so it keeps the attackers in their toes during the action phase not knowing where the roamer is at all times because they are always moving. My next favorite op is Tubarao who is another great roamer but that si my play style for him mainly his ability the” Zoto canister” freezes a area around the canister slowing any ops in the area and freezing and gadgets for both side for a certain amount of time I love his gun the “Ar 15.50” which is the DMR form of the m16 it has good stopping power meaning it does much more damage than ur average SMG and AR pair that with a good trigger finger like me and that things is no longer a hard hitting DMR its a hard hitting AR but I use him as a roamer other than a time waster because on maps like club house and border I can prep a barricade meaning I hit it twice then once I hear a enemy near the door I also do this with Solis I hop out exposing my positon try to atleast get 1 kill then hop back in and hold the area if they leave me alone and rush for site I rush to site amd help lock it down.
